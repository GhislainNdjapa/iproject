            <h6> Ghislain Ndjapa </h6>
            <p>
             My name is  Ghislain Tchakounte  Ndjapa. A young Cameroonian who grew up in the small town of Buea in Cameroon. I currently study computing at the African Leadership College (ALC) in Mauritius.
             I am a very ambitious young man who hopes to some day have a great impact on the world. I'm passionate about problem solving and I believe if you want something as bad as you want to breath, you will achieve it.

             I find things like travelling very interesting because it gives me exposure to new cultures and new people which certainly leaves me with an opportunity to learn something new. I also find entrepreneurship very  interesting though said not to be an easy journey by many people. I find cloud computing, Blockchain and cryptography very interesting because these are software methodologies which are bring massive change to the world.

            I speak and write two languages, English and French.
